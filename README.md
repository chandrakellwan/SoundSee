# SoundSee - Visual Beat Maker

<strong>Focused on simplicity of UX/UI design</strong>

SoundSee is a visual beat maker which turns your computer into a musical instrument.

The user is first prompted to enter or create a username and password. The app then authenticates the user.

Brilliantly colored animations and captivating sounds are triggered when keys are pressed on the keyboard.

This Full-Stack application utilizes: 

<strong>MERN Stack</strong> (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js)<br>
<strong>Material-UI</strong> (a set of React components that implement Google's material design)<br>
<strong>Passport</strong> (for user-authentication)<br>
<strong>Howler.js</strong> (for sounds)<br>
<strong>Paper.js and Canvas</strong> (for displaying graphics)

*This application is still in development stage.
