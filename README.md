# SoundSee - visual beat maker

Individual Project: Focused on simplicity of User Experience

SoundSee is a visual beat maker which turns your computer into a musical instrument.

The user is first prompted to enter or create a username and password. The app then authenticates the user.

Brilliantly colored animations and captivating sounds are triggered when keys are pressed on the keyboard.

This Full-Stack application utilizes: 

MERN Stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node)<br>
Material-UI (a set of React components that implement Google's material design)<br>
Passport (for user-authentication)<br>
Howler.js (for sounds)<br>
Paper.js and Canvas (for displaying graphics).

*This application is still in development stage.
